# .cargo-machete.toml — deps used only for embedded target or via cfg/link-time magic
#
# cargo machete performs a text-search based analysis. Some dependencies are
# "used" only through:
#   - #[panic_handler] registration (panic-probe, cortex-m-rt)
#   - defmt global logger init (defmt-rtt, defmt)
#   - Link-time symbol injection (cortex-m-rt provides exception vectors)
#   - cfg(target_arch = "arm") guards that machete doesn't evaluate
#
# These deps are legitimately required but appear unused to static analysis.
# Suppress them here rather than polluting source files with #[allow] comments.
